/*
The code you provided is another variation of the "Hello World" program, but this time the `main` method has a different parameter name. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The program starts with the declaration of a class named `HelloWorld3`.

2. Within the `HelloWorld3` class, there is a `main` method. It has a modified parameter name: `String hi_hello_welcome[]`. In Java, the parameter name is not significant; what matters is the type and order of the parameters. Therefore, this parameter name is valid, although it is unconventional.

3. The `main` method serves as the entry point of the program, just like in the previous examples.

4. Inside the `main` method, there is a single line of code: `System.out.println("Hello World!");`, which prints "Hello World!" to the console, just like before.

5. The `System.out` and `println` parts work the same way as in the previous examples.

6. After executing the `println` statement, the `main` method ends, and the program terminates.

When you run this Java program, it will output the following:

```
Hello World!
```

In summary, this version of the "Hello World" program demonstrates that you can use different parameter names for the `main` method as long as they follow the proper syntax rules. However, it is generally recommended to use the conventional name `args` for clarity and readability, as it is widely recognized in the Java community.

/*
The code you provided is another version of the "Hello World" program, but with a slight variation in the placement of access modifiers. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The program starts with the declaration of a class named `HelloWorld2`.

2. Within the `HelloWorld2` class, there is a `main` method. It has the same signature as the previous example: `static public void main(String[] args)`. The access modifier `static` and `public` are swapped in this case, but it is still a valid syntax.

3. The `main` method serves as the entry point of the program, just like in the previous example.

4. Inside the `main` method, there is a single line of code: `System.out.println("Hello World!");`, which prints "Hello World!" to the console, just like before.

5. The `System.out` and `println` parts work the same way as in the previous example.

6. After executing the `println` statement, the `main` method ends, and the program terminates.

When you run this Java program, it will output the following:

```
Hello World!
```

In summary, this version of the "Hello World" program demonstrates that access modifiers (`static` and `public`) can be placed in different orders without affecting the program's functionality. Java allows flexibility in the placement of access modifiers, as long as they follow the proper syntax rules.

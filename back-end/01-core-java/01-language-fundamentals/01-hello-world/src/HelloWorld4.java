 /*
 The code you provided is another variation of the "Hello World" program. This time, the `main` method has a different syntax for the `args` parameter. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The program starts with the declaration of a class named `HelloWorld4`.

2. Within the `HelloWorld4` class, there is a `main` method. The parameter for this method is `String... args`. This syntax is known as "varargs" or "variable arity parameters" in Java. It allows the `main` method to accept an arbitrary number of `String` arguments.

3. The `main` method serves as the entry point of the program, just like in the previous examples.

4. Inside the `main` method, there is a single line of code: `System.out.println("Hello World!");`, which prints "Hello World!" to the console, just like before.

5. The `System.out` and `println` parts work the same way as in the previous examples.

6. After executing the `println` statement, the `main` method ends, and the program terminates.

When you run this Java program, it will output the following:

```
Hello World!
```

In summary, this version of the "Hello World" program demonstrates the usage of varargs syntax for the `main` method's `args` parameter. It allows the method to accept multiple `String` arguments, which can be useful when you want to pass a varying number of command-line arguments to your program. However, in this specific example, since we are not utilizing any command-line arguments, the output is the same as in the previous examples.
